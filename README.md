# Precipitation Data Code Challenge

This repository is for the [JBA code challenge](https://jbasoftware.com/careers/code-challenge/). The challenge is to load some data on precipitation over time.

The data can be found on the JBA code challenge page, and the file was named `cru-ts-2-10.1991-2000-cutdown.pre`, but this filename is passed as a parameter to the main function, and so can be different.

Running this R Code was done in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), after setting the working directory as the directory of the repository.

R is a statistical language, and is used to analyse data. Loading the data into R allows it to be visualised, and analysed, with very little additional effort.
